# Create new company in BC without data

## Task

Your task is to create a new company in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central for "Maple Leaf Organics", an organic food and beverage distributor based in Calgary, Canada. That company doesn't need to have previous data or settings. We will start from scratch.

## Solution

1. Let's check what companies we have currently in our BC environment.
Find search sign on top header and click it.

Type "companies" in opened search box and you will see results of your search.

Click on "Companies" and Companies page will open. As you see I have only demo company in my BC environment.

Now I am going to press "Arrow down" button next to "New" button, and it will give me option to "Create new company" which we need to click.
In opened wizard window you need to click "Next" button

In next window type "Maple Leaf Organics Inc." in company name field. Then select "Create New - No Data". After that click "Next" button.

On next step system will ask to assign users for new company. I selected myself. After that you will see final wizard window. You need to press "Finish" button

To verify that new company is created, open "Companies" page. As you can see now I have two companies in my environment.
